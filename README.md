An open source implementation of **industry-grade** DRM(Digital Rights Management) or Key System. The common Key Systems we know are PlayReady of Microsoft, Widevine of Google and FairPlay of Apple. And china has ChinaDRM Key System specification.

This Key System is intended to work with [ISO Common Encryption(CENC) Protection Scheme](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:23001:-7:ed-2:v1:en) and [W3C EME(Encrypted Media Extensions)](https://w3c.github.io/encrypted-media/).
